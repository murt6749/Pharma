      <h2>Summary of Key Concepts in Steroids</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Definition:</strong> Steroids are naturally occurring organic compounds and their derivatives, playing vital roles in biology, medicine, and chemistry.</li>
        <li><strong>Structure:</strong> They share a common gonane nucleus (17 carbons in four rings: A, B, C, and D).</li>
        <li><strong>Stereochemistry:</strong> Variations such as cis and trans isomers affect the 3D shape and biological activity.</li>
        <li><strong>Numbering:</strong> A fixed carbon numbering system aids in nomenclature and modification.</li>
        <li><strong>Biosynthesis:</strong> Derived from cholesterol through a multi-step pathway (acetate → mevalonate → squalene → lanosterol → cholesterol).</li>
        <li><strong>Key Enzymes:</strong> Enzymes such as HMG-CoA reductase and CYP11A1 are essential in steroid biosynthesis.</li>
        <li><strong>Cholesterol Sources:</strong> Cells synthesize cholesterol de novo, uptake LDL, and store it in lipid droplets.</li>
        <li><strong>Steroid Hormones:</strong> Include glucocorticoids, mineralocorticoids, androgens, estrogens, and progestogens.</li>
        <li><strong>Transport & Action:</strong> Steroid hormones are lipid soluble and circulate bound to specific binding proteins.</li>
        <li><strong>Clinical Relevance:</strong> Synthetic steroids and cholesterol regulation are key in treating various diseases.</li>
