                options: [
                    "Taxus brevifolia",
                    "Datura stramonium",

                ],
                correct: 1,
                explanation: "Datura stramonium, commonly known as Jimson weed, is a well-known source of the alkaloid scopolamine. This compound acts as an anticholinergic agent by blocking acetylcholine receptors in the nervous system, thereby reducing nausea and preventing motion sickness."
            },

                ],
                correct: 2,
                explanation: "Taxus brevifolia, also known as the Pacific yew tree, produces Taxolâ€”a complex diterpenoid compound. Taxol stabilizes microtubules and prevents their disassembly, which in turn inhibits cell division in cancer cells, making it an important chemotherapeutic agent."
            },
            {
                q: "Aspirin, used for reducing pain and inflammation, is associated with which plant source?",

                ],
                correct: 1,
                explanation: "Filipendula ulmaria, commonly known as meadowsweet, contains natural salicylic acid derivatives. These compounds were historically used for pain relief and inflammation control, serving as the foundation for the development of modern aspirin."
            },
            {
                q: "Morphine and Codeine, secondary metabolites used to ease pain and suppress coughing, are obtained from:",

                ],
                correct: 1,
                explanation: "Papaver somniferum, the opium poppy, is the source of opiate alkaloids such as morphine and codeine. These compounds are extracted from the poppyâ€™s latex and have powerful analgesic and antitussive effects, making them central to pain management and cough suppression."
            },
            {
                q: "Pseudoephedrine, used to reduce nasal congestion, is derived from which plant?",
                options: [
                    "Filipendula ulmaria",
                    "Papaver somniferum",
                    "Ephedra sinica",
                    "Catharanthus roseus"
                ],
                correct: 2,
                explanation: "Ephedra sinica, also known as Ma Huang, produces pseudoephedrineâ€”a compound that acts as a decongestant. Pseudoephedrine works by constricting blood vessels in the nasal passages, thereby reducing swelling and alleviating congestion."
            },
            {
                q: "Quinine, an anti-malarial drug, is extracted from:",
                options: [
                    "Taxus brevifolia",
                    "Cinchona pubescens",
                    "Ephedra sinica",
                    "Filipendula ulmaria"
                ],
                correct: 1,
                explanation: "Cinchona pubescens, one of the species in the Cinchona genus, is the natural source of quinine. Quinine interferes with the growth cycle of the malaria parasite, and its discovery was crucial in the fight against malaria."
            },
            {
                q: "Vinblastine, an anti-cancer drug, is obtained from which plant?",
                options: [
                    "Papaver somniferum",
                    "Taxus brevifolia",

                    "Datura stramonium"
                ],
                correct: 2,
                explanation: "Catharanthus roseus, commonly known as the Madagascar periwinkle, produces the vinca alkaloid vinblastine. Vinblastine works by disrupting microtubule formation during cell division, which is why it is used as a chemotherapeutic agent in cancer treatment."
            },
            {
                q: "What is the primary reason plants produce secondary metabolites?",
                options: [
                    "To attract pollinators",
                    "To enhance their growth rate",

                ],
                correct: 2,
                explanation: "Plants synthesize secondary metabolites mainly as a defense mechanism. These compounds help protect the plant from pathogens, herbivores, and environmental stresses. While some secondary metabolites have additional roles (such as attracting pollinators), their primary function is protective."
            },
